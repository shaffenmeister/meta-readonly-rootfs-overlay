# meta-readonly-rootfs-overlay

This OpenEmbedded layer provides the necessary scripts and configurations to
setup a writable root file system overlay on top of a read-only root file system.

## Why does this exists?

Having a read-only root file system is useful for many scenarios:

- Separate user specific changes from system configuration, and being able to
find differences
- Allow factory reset, by deleting the user specific changes
- Have a fallback image in case the user specific changes made the root file
system no longer bootable.

Because some data on the root file system changes on first boot or while the
system is running, just mounting the complete root file system as read-only
breaks many applications. There are different solutions to this problem:

- Symlinking/Bind mounting files and directories that could potentially change
while the system is running to a writable partition
- Instead of having a read-only root files system, mounting a writable overlay
root file system, that uses a read-only file system as its base and writes
changed data to another writable partition.

To implement the first solution, the developer needs to analyse which file
needs to change and then create symlinks for them. When doing factory reset,
the developer needs to overwrite every file that is linked with the factory
configuration, to avoid dangling symlinks/binds. While this is more work on the
developer side, it might increase the security, because only files that are
symlinked/bind-mounted can be changed. However, IMO that is better left to file
permissions.

This meta-layer provides the second solution. Here no investigation of writable
files are needed and factory reset can be done by just deleting all files or
formatting the writable volume.

## Adding the readonly-rootfs-overlay layer to your build

In order to use this layer, you need to make the build system aware of
it.

Assuming the readonly-rootfs-overlay layer exists at the top-level of your
OpenEmbedded source tree, you can add it to the build system by adding the
location of the readonly-rootfs-overlay layer to bblayers.conf, along with any
other layers needed. e.g.:

```
  BBLAYERS ?= " \
    /path/to/layers/meta \
    /path/to/layers/meta-poky \
    /path/to/layers/meta-yocto-bsp \
    /path/to/layers/meta-readonly-rootfs-overlay \
    "
```

To add the script to your image, just add:

```
  IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " initscripts-readonly-rootfs-overlay"
```

to your `local.conf` or image recipe. Or use
`core-image-rorootfs-overlay-initramfs` as initrd.

## Read-only root filesystem

If you use this layer you do *not* need to set `read-only-rootfs` in the
`IMAGE_FEATURES` or `EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES` variable.

## Kernel command line parameters

These examples are not meant to be complete. They just contain parameters that
are used by the initscript of this repository. Some additional paramters might
be necessary.

### Example using initrd:

```
root=/dev/sda1 rootrw=/dev/sda2
```

This cmd line start `/sbin/init` with the `/dev/sda1` partition as the read-only
rootfs and the `/dev/sda2` partition as the read-write persistent state.

```
root=/dev/sda1 rootrw=/dev/sda2 init=/bin/sh
```

The same as before but it now starts `/bin/sh` instead of `/sbin/init`.

### Example without initrd:

```
root=/dev/sda1 rootrw=/dev/sda2 init=/init
```

This cmd line starts `/sbin/init` with `/dev/sda1` partition as the read-only
rootfs and the `/dev/sda2` partition as the read-write persistent state. When
using this init script without an initrd, `init=/init` has to be set.

```
root=/dev/sda1 rootrw=/dev/sda2 init=/init rootinit=/bin/sh
```

The same as before but it now starts `/bin/sh` instead of `/sbin/init`

### Details

`root=` specifies the read-only root file system device. If this is not
specified, the current rootfs is used.

`rootfstype=` if support for the read-only file system is not build into the
kernel, you can specify the required module name here. It will also be used in
the mount command.

`rootoptions=` specifies the mount options of the read-only file system.
Defaults to `noatime,nodiratime`.

`rootinit=` if the `init` parameter was used to specify this init script,
`rootinit` can be used to overwrite the default (`/sbin/init`).

`rootrw=` specifies the read-write file system device. If this is not
specified, `tmpfs` is used.

`rootrwfstype=` if support for the read-write file system is not build into the
kernel, you can specify the required module name here. It will also be used in
the mount command.

`rootrwoptions=` specifies the mount options of the read-write file system.
Defaults to `rw,noatime,mode=755`.

`rootrwreset=` set to `yes` if you want to delete all the files in the
read-write file system prior to building the overlay root files system.
